With Dataflow processing log data and extracting features, follow-up data analysis is performed in AI platform:
- import data/features from BigQuery to Jupyter notebook instances;
- visualize data and select features;
- apply machine learning approaches to detect anomalies;
- deploy trained models;
- make predictions with deployed models.
